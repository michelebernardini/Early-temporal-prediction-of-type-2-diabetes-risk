The aim of this study was to propose a multiple instance learning boosting algorithm, named MIL-Boost. The MIL-Boost was applied to past electronic health record patients' information stored by a unique General Prctitioner in order to create a predictive model capable of early predicting insulin resistance worsening (low vs high T2D risk) in terms of TyG index.

We tested the predictive performance of the MIL-Boost approach on the Italian Federation of General Practitioners dataset, named FIMMG_pred dataset, publicly available at the following link: http://vrai.dii.univpm.it/content/fimmgpred-dataset

Run MILBoost.m file to replicate the MIL-Boost experimental procedure.

The authors have been inspired in part by the Multiple Instance Learning algorithm developed by David M. J. Tax (https://github.com/DMJTax/mil).
