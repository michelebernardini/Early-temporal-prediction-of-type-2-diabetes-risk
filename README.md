# Early temporal prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Risk Conditions from a General Practitioner Electronic Health Record: a Multiple Instance Learning Boosting Approach
submitted to Artificial Intelligence in Medicine by M. Bernardini, M. Morettini, L. Romeo, E. Frontoni and L. Burattini

The aim of this study was to propose a multiple instance learning boosting algorithm, named MIL-Boost. The MIL-Boost was applied to past electronic health record patients' information stored by a unique General Prctitioner in order to create a predictive model capable of early predicting insulin resistance worsening (low vs high T2D risk) in terms of TyG index.

We tested the predictive performance of the MIL-Boost approach on the Italian Federation of General Practitioners dataset, named FIMMG_pred dataset, publicly available at the following link: http://vrai.dii.univpm.it/content/fimmgpred-dataset

Matlab code to replicate the MIL-Boost experimental procedure with KNN data imputation is provided by the authors.
